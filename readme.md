OpenSplat
=============
OpenSplat is an open-source shooter when you will have to splat your opponents to liquidate them
You can transform to a reduced form to pass through obstacles or dive into your own paint, but beware the ennemies' one!

The dedicated server can be found in the opensplat-server repository

### Features
##### Main features
* Cover your territory with your team paint
* Liquidate your opponents with a wide-range of weapons
* Transform and hide yourself in your team's paint
* Customize your character (genre, colour, etc...)
* Buy weapons / clothing stuff for the style but also to get power-ups

##### Game modes
* Campaign: Play in single-player to save the world!
* Turf war: The winning team is the team who have spread more paint in the map
* Events: Work in progress, more informations available in the Zone :)

##### Other features
* Match-making using official / federated servers or your custom one
* Switch between first-person / third-person mode
* You can create levels (Any Quake3 like map editor such as J.A.C.K Editor or GtkRadiant will work, just use the FGD in `mapping` folder)

### Done features
* Uhm... nothing... for the moment
* Still working on the game engine (Oxygen Engine, coming soon)

### Hey, you look like that other squid game!
Many FPS look like same. Does that mean that all FPS are the same game?
